    <p>All of the data is now getting printed to the page! There's only one issue, though: we still haven't figured out how to separate the featured from the non-featured projects. All of the HTML we just created has the same col-12 col-md-6 classes for each project, meaning they'll look identical. We want featured projects to just have col-12 so that they run full-width no matter what. Let's fix that with another new method, called .filter(). Yes thats the data!</p>
