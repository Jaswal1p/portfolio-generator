    <p>If we run app.js and answer all of the required prompts from the command line, we should see that both index.html and style.css were created in dist. If it doesn't look like this, or if there is an error printed to the command line, double-check that the dist folder is created in the correct location, directly at the root of the project's directory.</p>

            <p>Essentially, we wait for confirmation that the .writeFile() method ran successfully. When we get that confirmation, which in this case simply means not receiving an error, we then execute the .copyFile() method. It isn't mandatory for the application to work, but it does make the application run its functions one at a time, making it easier for us to track what's going on when.</p>

            <p>To execute the code in order, let's try and have the fs.copyFile() functionality occur inside the callback function for fs.writeFile(). This way, we know that the .writeFile() method successfully created the HTML file before we even attempt to copy the CSS file.</p>

            <p>We must always consider this when dealing with asynchronous code. We can have both of the fs functions run concurrently, because one isn't dependent on the other, but that could make it harder for us to determine what went wrong if an error occurs.</p>

            <p>Where do we want to include this functionality? It should probably go in the same .then() callback as the .writeFile() method so that it doesn't execute until we're done answering the prompts. But where exactly?</p>
